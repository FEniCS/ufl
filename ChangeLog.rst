Changelog
=========

2021.1.0
-------------

- Mixed dimensional domain support

2019.1.0 (2019-04-17)
---------------------

- Remove scripts
- Remove LaTeX support (not functional)
- Add support for complex valued elements; complex mode
  is chosen by ``compute_form_data(form, complex_mode=True)`` typically
  by a form compiler; otherwise UFL language is agnostic to the choice
  of real/complex domain

2018.1.0 (2018-06-14)
---------------------

- Remove python2 support

2017.2.0 (2017-12-05)
---------------------

- Add geometric quantity ``CellDiameter`` defined as a set diameter
  of the cell, i.e., maximal distance between any two points of the
  cell; implemented on simplices and quads/hexes
- Rename internally used reference quantities
  ``(Cell|Facet)EdgeVectors`` to ``Reference(Cell|Facet)EdgeVectors``
- Add internally used quantites ``CellVertices``,
  ``(Cell|Facet)EdgeVectors`` which are physical-coordinates-valued;
  will be useful for further geometry lowering implementations
  for quads/hexes
- Implement geometry lowering of ``(Min|Max)(Cell|Facet)EdgeLength``
  for quads and hexes

2017.1.0.post1 (2017-09-12)
---------------------------

- Change PyPI package name to fenics-ufl.

2017.1.0 (2017-05-09)
---------------------

- Add the ``DirectionalSobolevSpace`` subclass of ``SobolevSpace``. This
  allows one to use spaces where elements have varying continuity in
  different spatial directions.
- Add ``sobolev_space`` methods for ``HDiv`` and ``HCurl`` finite
  elements.
- Add ``sobolev_space`` methods for ``TensorProductElement`` and
  ``EnrichedElement``.  The smallest shared Sobolev space will be
  returned for enriched elements. For the tensor product elements, a
  ``DirectionalSobolevSpace`` is returned depending on the order of the
  spaces associated with the component elements.

2016.2.0 (2016-11-30)
---------------------

- Add call operator syntax to ``Form`` to replace arguments and
  coefficients. This makes it easier to e.g. express the norm
  defined by a bilinear form as a functional. Example usage::

    # Equivalent to replace(a, {u: f, v: f})
    M = a(f, f)
    # Equivalent to replace(a, {f:1})
    c = a(coefficients={f:1})
- Add call operator syntax to ``Form`` to replace arguments and
  coefficients::

    a(f, g) == replace(a, {u: f, v: g})
    a(coefficients={f:1}) == replace(a, {f:1})
- Add ``@`` operator to ``Form``: ``form @ f == action(form, f)``
  (python 3.5+ only)
- Reduce noise in Mesh str such that ``print(form)`` gets more short and
  readable
- Fix repeated ``split(function)`` for arbitrary nested elements
- EnrichedElement: Remove ``+/*`` warning

  In the distant past, ``A + B => MixedElement([A, B])``.  The change
  that ``A + B => EnrichedElement([A, B])`` was made in ``d622c74`` (22
  March 2010).  A warning was introduced in ``fcbc5ff`` (26 March 2010)
  that the meaning of ``+`` had changed, and that users wanting a
  ``MixedElement`` should use ``*`` instead.  People have, presumably,
  been seeing this warning for 6 1/2 years by now, so it's probably safe
  to remove.
- Rework ``TensorProductElement`` implementation, replaces
  ``OuterProductElement``
- Rework ``TensorProductCell`` implementation, replaces
  ``OuterProductCell``

- Updates to old manual for publishing on fenics-ufl.readthedocs.org
- Bugfix for ufl files with utf-8 encoding

  ufl.algorithms.apply_derivatives.CONDITIONAL_WORKAROUND = True
  at the top of your program.
- Allow sum([expressions]) where expressions are nonscalar by defining expr+0==expr
- Allow form=0; form -= other;
