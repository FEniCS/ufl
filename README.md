# UFL - Unified Form Language

The Unified Form Language (UFL) is a domain specific language for
declaration of finite element discretizations of variational forms. More
precisely, it defines a flexible interface for choosing finite element
spaces and defining expressions for weak forms in a notation close to
mathematical notation.

UFL is part of the FEniCS Project. For more information, visit
