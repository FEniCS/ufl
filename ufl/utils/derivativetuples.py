    given total order n and given geometric dimension gdim. This

    each tuple of length n specifies the coordinate directions of the
    n derivatives. The second is a corresponding list of tuples, where
    each tuple of length gdim specifies the number of derivatives in
    each direction. Both lists have length gdim^n and are ordered as
    expected by the UFC function tabulate_basis_derivatives.
