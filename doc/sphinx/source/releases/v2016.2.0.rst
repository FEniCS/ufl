Changes in the next release
===========================


Summary of changes
==================

- Deprecate ``.cell()``, ``.domain()``, ``.element()`` in favour of
  ``.ufl_cell()``, ``.ufl_domain()``, ``.ufl_element()``, in multiple
  classes, to allow closer integration with DOLFIN
- Remove deprecated properties
  ``cell.{d,x,n,volume,circumradius,facet_area}``
- Remove ancient ``form2ufl`` script
- Large reworking of symbolic geometry pipeline
- Implement symbolic Piola mappings
- ``OuterProductCell`` and ``OuterProductElement`` are merged into
  ``TensorProductCell`` and ``TensorProductElement`` respectively
- Better degree estimation for quadrilaterals
- Expansion rules for Q, DQ, RTCE, RTCF, NCE and NCF on tensor product
  cells
- Add discontinuous Taylor elements
- Add support for the mapping ``double covariant Piola`` in ``uflacs``
- Add support for the mapping ``double contravariant Piola`` in ``uflacs``
- Support for tensor-valued subelements in ``uflacs`` fixed
- Replacing ``Discontinuous Lagrange Trace`` with ``HDiv Trace`` and removing ``TraceElement``
- Assigning ``Discontinuous Lagrange Trace`` and ``DGT`` as aliases for ``HDiv Trace``

Detailed changes
================

- Add call operator syntax to Form to replace arguments and
  coefficients. This makes it easier to e.g. express the norm
  defined by a bilinear form as a functional. Example usage::
     # Equivalent to replace(a, {u: f, v: f})
     M = a(f, f)
     # Equivalent to replace(a, {f:1})
     c = a(coefficients={f:1})
- Add call operator syntax to Form to replace arguments and coefficients::
    a(f, g) == replace(a, {u: f, v: g})
    a(coefficients={f:1}) == replace(a, {f:1})
- Add @ operator to Form: form @ f == action(form, f) (python 3.5+ only)
- Reduce noise in Mesh str such that print(form) gets more short and readable
- Fix repeated split(function) for arbitrary nested elements
- EnrichedElement: Remove +/* warning
   In the distant past, A + B => MixedElement([A, B]).  The change that
   A + B => EnrichedElement([A, B]) was made in d622c74 (22 March 2010).
   A warning was introduced in fcbc5ff (26 March 2010) that the meaning of
   "+" had changed, and that users wanting a MixedElement should use "*"
   instead.  People have, presumably, been seeing this warning for 6 1/2
   years by now, so it's probably safe to remove.
- Rework TensorProductElement implementation, replaces OuterProductElement
- Rework TensorProductCell implementation, replaces OuterProductCell
- Remove OuterProductVectorElement and OuterProductTensorElement
- Add FacetElement and InteriorElement
- Add Hellan-Herrmann-Johnson element
- Add support for double covariant and contravariant mappings in mixed elements
- Support discontinuous Taylor elements on all simplices
- Some more performance improvements
- Minor bugfixes
- Improve Python 3 support
- More permissive in integer types accepted some places
- Make ufl pass almost all flake8 tests
- Add bitbucket pipelines testing
- Improve documentation
