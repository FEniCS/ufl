Changes in version 2017.1.0
===========================

UFL 2017.1.0 was released on 2017-05-09.

Summary of changes
==================

- Add the ``DirectionalSobolevSpace`` subclass of ``SobolevSpace``. This
  allows one to use spaces where elements have varying continuity in
  different spatial directions.
- Add ``sobolev_space`` methods for ``HDiv`` and ``HCurl`` finite
  elements.
- Add ``sobolev_space`` methods for ``TensorProductElement`` and
  ``EnrichedElement``.  The smallest shared Sobolev space will be
  returned for enriched elements. For the tensor product elements, a
  ``DirectionalSobolevSpace`` is returned depending on the order of the
  spaces associated with the component elements.
