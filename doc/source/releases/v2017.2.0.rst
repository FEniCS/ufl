Changes in version 2017.2.0
===========================

UFL 2017.2.0 was released on 2017-12-05.

Summary of changes
==================

- Add ``CellDiameter`` expression giving diameter of a cell, i.e.,
  maximal distance between any two points of the cell. Implemented
  for all simplices and quads/hexes.
- Make ``(Min|Max)(Cell|Facet)EdgeLength`` working for quads/hexes

Detailed changes
================

- Add geometric quantity ``CellDiameter`` defined as a set diameter
  of the cell, i.e., maximal distance between any two points of the
  cell; implemented on simplices and quads/hexes
- Rename internally used reference quantities
  ``(Cell|Facet)EdgeVectors`` to ``Reference(Cell|Facet)EdgeVectors``
- Add internally used quantites ``CellVertices``,
  ``(Cell|Facet)EdgeVectors`` which are physical-coordinates-valued;
  will be useful for further geometry lowering implementations
  for quads/hexes
- Implement geometry lowering of ``(Min|Max)(Cell|Facet)EdgeLength``
  for quads and hexes
